# Super Joystick

Forked from [Unity-Joystick-Pack](https://github.com/FeneraxStudios/Unity-Joystick-Pack)

This project introduces several enhancements over the original:

1. Event Registration: Added event handlers for OnPointerDown and OnPointerUp.
2. Namespace Management: Introduced the SuperJoystick namespace to prevent potential conflicts when integrating this package into your projects.
3. Resource Optimization: Adjusted image material resolutions to be divisible by 4, optimizing resource utilization.
